A few notes on Exam 1:
* The exam will take place on Tuesday, 05/12, and will cover everything from Lessons 1-8. 
* I have posted 5 Practice Exams and a study guide in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nVr1be9sXpVD0vrnFLxYi6MCSfUtcf31" target="_blank"> shared Google Drive folder <i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>. 
* If you do well on this exam, you do not have to take the final exam. If you do not do well, you will have another chance to take the exam and your best grade will count twice. Your total exam score will count for 30% of your total grade.
* You will be taking the exam using a piece of software called the Lockdown Browser. We will be doing a trial run of this software during the week of 5/4.
* The best way to study for the exam is to do all of the practice exams and make sure you understand what each of the questions is asking you to do. After Thursday, 4/30, we will have gone over all of the material that will be covered in Exam 1.
