In this lesson, we're going to go over (1) how to create your own functions, and (2) using PIP (a command line tool to install third-party Python libraries). After this lesson, we will have covered everything that you need to know in order to complete [Tutorial 1](06tutorial) and [HW2](../assignments/hw2)
