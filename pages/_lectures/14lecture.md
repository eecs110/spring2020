Today, you will be learning to work with files --  including reading them, writing them, and appending to them. Because many file formats involve text, you will also be learning to work with some common string functions.

Given that a vast quantity of data is stored in files, databases, etc., learning to access, manipulate, and write data in various formats for subsequent storage is a critical programming skill.
