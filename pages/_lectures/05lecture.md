<img class="module-image" src="/spring2020/assets/images/lectures/lecture_03_functions.png" /> The next two lessons will primarily be dedicated to functions. In this lesson, we will review several different concepts. First, we will go over how to use **the command line** in order to run our Python files. Next, we will introduce two new data types in the "sequence family" -- lists and tuples -- which we will use in HW2 and in this week's tutorial. Finally, we will introduce functions, including some basic terminology and why they are useful. We'll also take a look at some examples of how to use built-in functions. In the next lesson (Lesson 4), we will practice building our own functions and modules. <br><br>This week's tutorial (Tutorial 1) and homework (Homework 2) will be based on content reviewd in this lesson and the next one. You are strongly encouraged to review the content in these lessons *before* trying the tutorial/homework.
